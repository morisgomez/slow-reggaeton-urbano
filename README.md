# Slow-Reggaeton-Urbano
This is a personal creative project. I highlighted my Latino culture by showcasing a few slow and revered music videos from the reggaeton urbano genre - a genre I was raised listening to. 

Detailed Summary:
I was raised listening to Latino reggaeteon artists such as Ivy Queen, Arcangel, DJ Flex, Rakim & Ken-Y, Residente, and Don Omar. However, recently, there has been a shift from reggaeteon to reggaeton urbano. I depict this new era through music videos from Bad Bunny, Rauw Alejandro, Sech and Jhay Cortez - to name a few.
